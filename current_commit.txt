Get failing students, rewrite get unused categories

* create_gradebook_summary - get unused categories
** write getUnusedCats helper function
** import CPSTeacherUnusedCategories -> df
** filter UnusedCats by teacher fullname
** remove unncessary columns from UnusedCats
** group UnusedCats by subject
** remove empty groups from UnusedCats
** store UnusedCatsBySubject if not empty.

*** NOTE - Will reconsider inferring missing categories later -
  right now, need to prioritize safety. There's some odd things
  about AllCategories, like including categories from last year(?)
  which make it more complex to be sure I'm right about which categories
  are actually unused. Nicki was right -- it's really the spread-out
  nature of all of this data which makes this work difficult. I need
  to think how I can use her work to simplify this. I need also to take
  a step back and relax once this report is done, I feel all wrung out.

* create_gradebook_summary - get failing students
** import grade data
** filter grade data by teacher
** filter grade data by students with Quarter Averages
  below F cutoff
** group grade data by Class
