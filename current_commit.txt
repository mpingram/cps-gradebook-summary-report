Test and refactor get_gradebook_summary

* get_gradebook_summary.py
** split each data-getting method up into pure,
    testable functions
** reuse as much data-loading code as possible for
    performance increase
** minor touch -- color-code letter grades in pie chart

* new file get_gradebook_summary_test.py
** test each data-getting method for correctness
    with expectations based off available data
